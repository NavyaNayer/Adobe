      "refined_text": "Best Time to Visit: The best time to visit the South of France is during the spring (April to June) and fall (September to October) when the weather is pleasant, and the tourist crowds are smaller. Transportation: The region is well-connected by an extensive network of trains, buses, and flights. Renting a car is also a great option for exploring the countryside and smaller towns. Language: While French is the oï¬ƒcial language, English is widely spoken in tourist areas. Learning a few basic French phrases can enhance your travel experience."
